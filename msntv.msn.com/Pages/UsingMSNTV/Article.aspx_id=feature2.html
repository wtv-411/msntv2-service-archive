Joe User (not his real name) turns on his MSN TV 2 player and is annoyed to see that yet another update is occurring. "This is the third update this month!" There goes another two hours of my life down the drain! And the worst thing of all is that after it's done, I can't even tell what's been updated! Everything seems to work just like it did before."<p>Aha! There's a clue. Joe is suffering from Frequent Update Selection Syndrome (FUSS). His player has experienced a problem — possibly an interruption to its power supply — that has made it accept an update (or perhaps several) in an effort to function properly. <p>When your MSN TV 2 player takes an update, it's downloading new software. (An update can take as long as a few hours if you're using a dial-up connection.) MSN TV offers updates a few times a year; you'll know when your player has taken one of these "official" updates, because after the update is complete you'll receive an e-mail message describing new or enhanced MSN TV features. But if your player frequently accepts updates, and if afterwards you don't see an e-mail from MSN TV describing new features, you can be pretty sure that your player is trying to fix a problem. And the best way it knows how to fix problems is by starting with a clean slate — by taking an update.<p>In many cases, you can prevent your player from experiencing the types of problems that will make it take frequent updates. Try the tips below.<ul><li>Sometimes it might seem like your player is taking a long time to turn on. Be patient. The more times you interrupt your player's power-on cycle by turning it off, the more likely it will perceive these interruptions as a problem and take an update. It's better to wait an extra minute or two to see if your player turns on, than to spend an hour or more waiting while it updates.<p><li>Make sure you use your keyboard or remote to turn your player on and off. If your player is plugged into a power strip, don't turn the player on and off by flipping the on/off switch on the power strip. Similarly, if your player is plugged in to an outlet that's controlled by a wall switch, don't use the switch to turn the player on and off.<p><li>Make sure your player doesn't become damaged by overheating. Don't place it in an enclosed cabinet with closed doors, or put it in a stack of other devices such as VCRs or DVD players.<p><li>If your player seems to be operating sluggishly, check its system health. (If a player's system health gets bad enough it might freeze up, making it necessary for you to unplug it — which might encourage it to take an update.) To assess your player's system health:<p><ol><li>From the sign-in page, press <b>Favs</b> on your keyboard. The System Information page appears.<li>Look at the "System Health" category. It should say "OK." If your player's system health is "Poor," choose <b>Reset System</b> to turn your player off and back on, which should restore the system to full working order. (Be patient while your player is going through its power off/on cycle, and don't interrupt this process. Wait until the green light on the front of the player has stopped flashing before you resume using your player.)</ol><p><li>The previous tips may help to keep your player from taking unnecessary updates. But when your player does require an official update (remember, you'll see a screen with the update details), you can set up your player to take the update at your convenience, instead of it happening when you turn on your player to use it. That's where the automatic-update feature comes in handy; you can tell your player to accept MSN TV updates at a particular time of day (or night), preferably while you're sleeping or away from your player. Here's how:<p><ol><li>Choose <b>Settings</b> from the home page.<li>Choose <b>Automatic update</b>. <li>On the page that appears, select the checkbox next to <b>"Check for and install updates."</b><li>Select the box next to <b>"Begin checks around"</b> and choose a time.<li>Choose <b>Save Changes.</b></ol></ul>Now you'll be able to tell official updates from unnecessary ones, minimize the number of unnecessary updates, and control when your player accepts official updates. In short, you should be able to save yourself a lot of time.</html> </td></tr></table><img height="1" width="1" src="http://c.msn.com/c.gif?PS=73711&amp;PI=68206&amp;DI=1455&amp;TP=http://msntv.msn.com/UsingMSNTV/Featurearticles.htm&amp;RF=" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt" xmlns:msntvuxp="msntvuxp.microsoft.com">
