You might have to jump through a few hoops, such as registering your chat nickname for certain services or features. But then you're free to chat with anyone in the public chat rooms (or "channels," as they're called in IRC) offered by the four IRC services featured on the Chat page. And that's where a few problems have cropped up. It's probably not you, but a few WebTV/MSN TV users have been exhibiting bad manners (or perhaps just not understanding chat etiquette) when they're chatting.<p>The people who have been using these IRC services for a while have a name for WebTV/MSN TV chatters: "Webbies." So if you see a comment in a room's topic description or conversation that's directed at Webbies, please heed it and give your fellow MSN TV users a good name. For example, one room's topic description asks Webbies not to "ASL" (ask for a person's age, sex, and location). Another room actively discourages Webbies from participating in chats. <p>But the vibes regarding Webbies aren't all negative. For example, AfterNet has created a room called WebTV that's just for us. (There are a few manners tips in that room's description, however, such as a request to ask someone's permission before "whispering" a private comment to them. The WebTV room's description also asks users to refrain from "trolling," or making deliberately provocative remarks.)<p>Please read the tips here to make your chatting experience — and everyone else's — more enjoyable.<p><b>Tip 1: Stick to the subject</b><br>Many chat rooms are simply places where people from all over get together to shoot the breeze. However, the folks in some rooms attempt to discuss the topic that's presented in the room's name and description: physics, science fiction, games, lonely housewives … Read the topic description (if there is one) before you enter a room, and see if it's a discussion you want to join. For example, if you want to talk about the latest movie you saw, you don't want to do so in a room that's devoted to computer programming.<p><b>Note:</b> Rooms are listed by the number of people in them; the rooms with the most people are at the top. Scroll down or choose <b>Next</b> to look for additional rooms with a topic that interests you.<p><b>Tip 2: Be polite</b><br>It's nice to say "hi" when you enter a room, and "bye" when you leave. If a conversation's not up your alley, you can simply leave the room and look for another chat. If a particular person in a room is bothering you, choose the <b>Ignore</b> button and check the box next to that person's name to block their comments (or check several names at once if you want to ignore more than one person). If a "troll" is trying to get your goat, don't take the bait. If everyone in the room ignores a troll, the troll will probably crawl off to bother people somewhere else.<p><b>Tip 3: Ask for help if you need it</b><br>If you don't understand, say, a chat abbreviation or term, ask the people in the room what it means. Most people are happy to help out. If you don't know how to use a particular chat feature, first take a look at the MSN TV help for IRC Chat by choosing <b>Help</b> in the upper-right corner of the page. (<b>Note:</b> You'll need to leave the room you're in to look at MSN TV Help.) If your question isn't answered by MSN TV Help, go to the help channel for the service you're using. To find the help channel, go to the service's main page, choose <b>Go to Room</b>, type <i>help</i>, and choose <b>Go To</b>. If that doesn't work, type the name of the chat service (such as <i>Starcha</i>t or <i>Chatuniverse</i>) instead of <i>help</i>. <p><b>Tip 4: Get to know the service you're using</b><br>Each of the four featured IRC services works a little differently. For example, you must register your chat nickname (or "nick") before you can enter the rooms offered by StarChat; you don't need to register your nickname to join a chat in ChatUniverse, but you do need to register your nickname to whisper to someone in a ChatUniverse room. Again, read the MSN TV Help or go to the service's help channel to see how that service works.<p><b>Tip 5: If you don't find a chat you like, try another chat service</b><br>If you don't find just what you're looking for in AfterNet, ChatNet, ChatUniverse, or StarChat, perhaps another IRC service has the room for you.<p>Choose <b>Chat</b> from the MSN TV home page to go to the main Chat page. Then, choose <b>Go directly to a chat service</b> and enter one of the following IRC services in the <b>Server</b> box:<ul><li>irc.chatsensations.net  <li>irc.v8d.org <li>irc.peachchat.com</ul>I'm glad we had this little chat. Well, OK, it was more of a monologue. But maybe you'll run into me in a chat room somewhere. They call me "erferta."</td></tr></table><img height="1" width="1" src="http://c.msn.com/c.gif?PS=73711&amp;PI=68206&amp;DI=1455&amp;TP=http://msntv.msn.com/UsingMSNTV/Featurearticles.htm&amp;RF=" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt" xmlns:msntvuxp="msntvuxp.microsoft.com">
