Don't worry; you'll still be able to visit hundreds of chat rooms, find discussions on all sorts of topics, and even create your own chat room and invite friends to it. <p>But instead of getting to all these chat features via MSN Chat, you can now get there by way of IRC, or Internet Relay Chat. The new setup will take a little getting used to, but you'll soon get the hang of it.<p>When you choose <b>Chat</b>, you'll see a list of four featured IRC services: ChatNet, AfterNet, Starchat, and ChatUniverse. Like MSN Chat, these services are gateways to hundreds of chat rooms. When you enter a room, you'll see some familiar buttons that let you "whisper" a private message to someone, add emoticons to your comments, see who is in a room, ignore individuals, show that you're temporarily away, and create your own chat room.<p>In addition to these familiar features, you'll notice a few differences as well. For example, you'll have to get used to some new terminology. People in the IRC world refer to chat rooms as "channels." And you can no longer choose a button to find out where a friend is chatting, as you could with MSN Chat. But the biggest difference between MSN Chat and Internet Relay Chat is that some IRC services require you to register your chat nickname and sign in to the service before you begin chatting.<p><b>Nickname nuances</b><br>With IRC, you cannot make up a chat nickname; your MSN TV account name (the name you use when you sign in) is your chat nickname. If you want to use a different chat nickname, you can create a new MSN TV user with a nickname you like, and sign in as that user to chat.<p>Some IRC services simply let you enter rooms and begin chatting. Others want you to register your nickname (sometimes called your "nick") before you can chat. An easy way to find out whether you need to register your nickname is to choose <b>Chat</b> from the home page, choose a chat service, and see if you can simply enter a room and chat. If you need to register your nickname, you'll see a message that tells you that.<p>In some cases, you won't need to register your nickname to chat, but will need to register it to use certain features, such as whispering or creating your own chat room.<p>The nickname registration process varies from one service to another. MSN TV Help has detailed instructions on registering your nickname for each of the featured IRC services. (<b>Tip:</b> The registration process can be somewhat lengthy. If you have a printer attached to your MSN TV 2 player, you might want to print the Help pages for registering your nickname.)<p><b>Getting help</b><br>If you follow the instructions in MSN TV Help and still have questions about registering your nickname, you may be able to find the information you need by visiting the help room (or "help channel") for the IRC service you're using. To find a service's help channel, follow these steps:<ol><li>Choose <b>Chat</b> from the home page. <li>Choose the IRC service you want to use. (Or, if you know the address of a different IRC server, choose <b>Go directly to a chat service</b> from the main Chat page.) <li>Choose <b>Go to Room</b>, and then type <i>help</i>. (If that doesn't work, type the name of the IRC service, such as <i>starchat</i>.) You'll enter a chat room where you can ask questions about using that service.</ol><b>Identifying yourself</b><br>Once you've registered with an IRC service, you'll be asked to identify your nickname (or "ID your nick," as those in the know say) each time you choose that service. As with registering your nickname, the process for ID'ing your nickname differs from one service to another. Read the MSN TV Help for detailed instructions, or go to the help channel for that service, as described above.<p><b>Time to chat</b><br>While registering your nickname can be a bit of a chore, you'll only have to do it once for each service you use. After you've registered, you'll find that chatting is very similar to what you were used to with MSN Chat: You'll enter a room, say hello to the other folks there, and use familiar buttons like <b>People List</b> and <b>Whisper</b>.<p>If you're new to chatting, choose <b>Help</b> to read the MSN TV help for Chat, or go to a service's help channel and ask your questions there.<p>Have fun.
